be a virtual computer, they are located in a data center and they run on
operating system like normal computers.

What is the role of the domain name?
	the role of the domain name is to help access a website on the internet
without knowing the IP address.

What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user

of the user over the network.



issues are with this infrastructure:

SPOF:
	Single Point Of Failure (SPOF), is a part of the system that, if it
fails the whole entire system stops from working.
	The above infrastructure has no redundancy that can help in avoiding
SPOFs, hence, any single failure in any part of the system will cause all the
system to stop.

Downtime when maintenance needed:
	In the infrastructure described, downtime is inevitable due to the
reliance on a single server and database for deployment and maintenance.
Consequently, users will be unable to access the website during this time.

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:
	Scaling becomes a problem when there's a significant influx of incoming
traffic with only one server in the system, there's no backup to share the
workload, leading to potential overload and system strain.
